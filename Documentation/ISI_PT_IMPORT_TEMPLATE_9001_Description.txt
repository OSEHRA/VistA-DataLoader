The ISI PT IMPORT TEMPLATE (#9001) can be used to help speed data entry for creating new patient records in 
VistA.  The file contains 15 fields that contain default values or masks for patient records.

This file fills the gaps on values not provided by the user during import.  User-provided input supersedes
the values in this file.  The ISI Data Loader first lays down the values from this file and then 
overwrites values with user supplied values (via the spreadheet) during an data loading session.  
 
There are five kinds of fields used in this file to create patient records:  parameters, static values, ranges,
string masks and numeric masks.   Parameters are values that provide information to the application, but do 
not contain data directly used in creating records.  Values are static values set to be used if a user supplied 
value is not provided.  Ranges provide upper and lower limits used to auto-generate values if user supplied v
alues are not provided.  String masks provide a core string with a "*" character that will be replaced by a
generated value.  Numeric masks provide a number to which will be appended with a generated 
number.

Examples of each kind of field:

NAME (9001,.01) is a parameter field. This field is identifies the Template (9001) record.

TYPE (9001,1) is a "static value" field.  If you provide a value for TYPE, this value is applied to all records created
by the Data Loader where the user has not provided their own TYPE OF PATIENT value (via the spreadsheet).

EARLIEST DATE OF BIRTH (9001,5) is a "range" field.  It provides that low end range used to randomly generate a Date
of Birth where the user has not provided a DOB.

NAME MASK (9001,2) is a string mask field.  When a string value of "*,Patient" is used in this field the Data Loader will
auto generate a patient name value (#2,.01) keying of the "*" character to substitute either incrimented 
numeric values or DFN values.  For instance with a "*,PATIENT" NAME MASK and no user supplied value the Data Loader
could generate a name of "ONE,PATIENT".  With a "LASTNAME,*" NAME MASK and no user supplied value, the
data loader could generate a name of "LASTNAME,ONE".

SSN MASK (9001,4) is a numeric mask field.   When a number value of 123456 is used in this field  and no SSN value is
supplied by the user, the Data Loader will auto generate the next available SSN using the core value of 123456.  For
instance the Data Loader could generate an SSN of 123456888.

Below is provided a list of Template fields and description of each

NAME (9001,.01) is parameter field.  The install package creates a record named "DEFAULT." This record should not be deleted or its name changed.   The Data Loader client uses this record.  
TYPE (9001,1) is a static value field.  The install value "NON-VETERAN (OTHER)." 
NAME MASK (9001,2) is a string mask field.  The install value is "*,PATIENT".	
SSN MASK (9001,4) is a numeric mask field.  The install value is 666.
SEX (9001,5) is a static value field.  The install value is empty.
EARLIEST DATE OF BIRTH (9001, 6) is a lower range field.  The install value is 1/1/29.
LATEST DATE OF BIRTH (9001,7) is an upper range field.  The install value is 05/24/12.
MARITAL STATUS (9001, 8) is a static value field.  The default value is empty.
ZIP+4 MASK (9001,9) is a numeric mask field.  The install value is 99999.
PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] MASK (9001,10) is a numeric mask field.  The install value is 999.
CITY (9001,11) is a static value field.  The install value is blank.
STATE (9001,12) is a static value field.  The install value is blank.
VETERAN (9001,13) is a static value field.  The install value is blank.
DFN_NAME (9001,14) is a parameter field.  The install value is "Y".
EMPLOYMENT STATUS (9001,15) is a static value field.  The install value is blank.

Note -- The ISI PT IMPORT TEMPLATE's functionality is especially useful for "batch" patient creation.  
By batch, is meant the ability to create a  large number of new patient records automatically -- each 
deriving key default values from values, ranges, and masks provided inside #9001.  This functionality
is not available for use through the Data Loader client application and can only be directly
accessed by utilizing the Patient import API (IMPORTPT^ISIIMP03).
